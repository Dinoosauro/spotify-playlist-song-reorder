### Order a playlist
If you want to order a current playlist, choose the playlist you want to convert from the list of items. After this, you'll see your playlist album art and a droplist. You should also see a switch: from here you can choose if you want to create a new playlist (quicker) or to order the current one. Now, click on the droplist. You'll see four sorting options: click on your preferred one. The website will start ordering all your songs.

### Create the disography of an artist:
If you want to add all the tracks of an artist to your playlist, you can do this. On the switch at the top of the page, choose "Create Author Playlist". Then, write the name of an artist, and click on their name.

Now, just like the playlist reordering process, you should see the singer image. Wait a little: the website now is getting all the albums of that artist, and you can see the progress of this operation in the alert under the image. After all the songs are fetched,write the name of your new playlist in the textbox. Finally, click on the dropdown item at the end of the page and choose your preferred sorting option. Wait a few seconds that the website add all the songs to the playlist

*I chose the two artists above randomly, not that you probably cared about it.*

## Known issues
- In a really long playlist, a really few items might not be moved. I'm looking to solve this issue.
